        <h1>All my worries</h1>  
            <p>All my days as a girl i never new i will come this far. 
            From what i suffered in the past, i thought i would never see this light. No wonder they say "Tomorrow get belle". 
            All from zero, im turning a great hero.</p> 
        <h2>Suffering and Hardship</h2>
            <p>Mommy came back from farm looking so tired and hungry, of cources she should after the hard labour at farm.
                She never cease to work even as she fasts and this got me wondering what kind of powers she has.</p>
